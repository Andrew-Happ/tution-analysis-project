# College Tuition and Early-Career Pay Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between college tuition costs (in-state and out-of-state) and early-career salary potential. The goal is to explore whether tuition correlates with early career earnings and whether private colleges charge significantly more than public colleges.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and merging using Python and SQL
- Regression analysis using statsmodels (OLS)
- Data manipulation with pandas
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Interpretation of statistical results

## Files in this Repository
- `notebook.ipynb` – The Jupyter notebook containing the full workflow: data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations
- `archive.zip` – Contains the original tuition datasets needed to run the notebook

## How to Use
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Extract the `archive.zip` file into the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Data Sources
- Tuition dataset: [Kaggle link if available]
- Salary dataset: [Payscale link if available]

## Key Insights
- Private colleges have significantly higher tuition than public colleges.
- Higher early-career pay potential is associated with higher tuition costs.
- The analysis demonstrates the application of regression models and data analysis techniques to real-world datasets.
